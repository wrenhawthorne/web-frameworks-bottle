        Let us begin with your health. Throwing bread into the sea may be one of the most underrated forms of gentle physical activity*. A finely executed toss engages the shoulders, core, and even the hips. This seaside ritual is not simply a physical motion, but a small meditation. It is an opportunity to stand at the shoreline, and to contemplate where the land truly ends and the sea truly begins. Join us, and fling half a loaf into the collective subconscious.
